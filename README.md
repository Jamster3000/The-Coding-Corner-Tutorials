# The Coding Corner Tutorials
This repository contains all tutorials that are written for `The Coding Corner` discord server.
Most if not all of these tutorials are written by myself, if they are written by someone else, that will be mentioned clearly, either by their name or by a name they go by online.

All the code presented in this repo is written by the writer of the tutorial therefor the code is open for use however. 
Images on the otherhand still respect and hold the copyright and licensing of the original creator - The Coding Corner will not use any images, audio, or other resources for commercial or money gaining purposes, they intend to be and should only be used for the purpose of tutorials to `The Coding Corner` and nothing more.
