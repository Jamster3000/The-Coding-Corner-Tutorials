# what is a README file
A README file is normally mark down or text file used to providd information about a project.

This file is normally the first thing someone seems in a GitHub Repository and the file typically catches peoples attention especially when they're trying to work with your project.

# what goes into a README file?
# name and description
```md
## Project Name
An innovative and efficient solution for [problem your project solves]. Built with [technologies used].
```
Although word it in a way that matches your style, this is just a basic example.

## Badges
Badges are...well badges that render on your README. THere are several badages that you can choose from.

```md
![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/username/project-name)
![Last Commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/username/project-name)
![GitHub Stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/username/project-name
```

These three badges are ideal and usful to see - It shows visitors information about your project at a quick glance.

These badges can be placed, ideally, towards the beginning or the end of the README file.
.


## For Large projects
For large projects or projects that require a larger README file, it would be ideal to use a `table of contents`

```md
## Table of Contents
- [About the Project](#about-the-project)
- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Features](#features)
- [Contributing](#contributing)
- [License](#license)
- [Contact](#contact)
```

This might look a little different depending on your exact layout of your README.

This structure allows people to click on each part of the table to be taken directly to the section of the README.


## About
You have given a summarisation of a description towards the top of your projecte, this is the perfect place to be descriptive, use paragraphs, bullet points, and images to go into more depth of your project.


## Installation
Provide clear instructions on how to install or access the project for themselves. Don't tell people to download the code, that's too vague or obvious. Maybe someone would need to install X, Y, and Z libraries to be able to run your code; maybe your project has to be built before it can run.

If there really is no installation instructions or anything that would fit in this section you don't have to put this section and clutter your README up.


## Usage
Explain how someone can use project. Think, they've downloaded the code, build and installed everything, they have it running, but what do they do? what can they do? how do they do it? You can provide screenshots, GIF images, and more to explain all this.

Here you may want an additional section called `Features` to list all the features of your project.

.

## Contributing
Here is where you can specify how you want people to contribute to your project.
Let's say there is a visitor that wants to help out, or notices there's a bug that you've not been able to fix, maybe they'd be willing to help out, but some people might not know how to contribute to your project respectfully.

For example
```md
## Contributing
Contributions are what make the open-source community amazing. Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**.  
1. Fork the Project  
2. Create your Feature Branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)  
3. Commit your Changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)  
4. Push to the Branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)  
5. Open a Pull Request  
```


# License
Its a good idea to include a license to tell other developers how they are allowed to use your project.
GitHub already has support for Licenses but it's a good idea to bring it up in your README to make it clear to anyone who sees it.

You don't need to cover the whole License, just something short and simple

E.g.
```md
## License
Distributed under the MIT License. See `LICENSE` for more information.
```


# Contact
This is how someone could contact you in relation to the project. 
Don't put this section in if you really don't want people to contact you for any reason.


## Acknowledgements (Optional)
This is where you list credit contributors, libraries, or inspirations.


.


## Bonus Tips
- **Use Visuals** - Use GIF's Images, Coed Snippets and markdown effeciently.

- **Emojis** - Throw some emojis into your README to make it more friendly.

- **Keep it updated** - whilst you're developing and updating your project, make sure to keep the README updated with the project.
